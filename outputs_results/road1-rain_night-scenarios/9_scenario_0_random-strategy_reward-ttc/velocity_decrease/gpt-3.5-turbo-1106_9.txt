You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,

Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with the ego vehicle and NPC at rest, and the weather conditions are specified. The initial positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities of the ego vehicle and NPC are provided. The scenario seems to be realistic at this point, as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions.
At 0.5 seconds: Both the ego vehicle and NPC start moving with realistic velocities and accelerations. The positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities are consistent with the driving intentions and the environmental conditions. The scenario remains realistic.
At 1.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move in a manner consistent with their driving intentions and the environmental conditions. The scenario maintains its realism.
At 1.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and interactions continue to be consistent with the driving intentions and the environmental conditions. The scenario remains realistic.
At 2.0 seconds: The vehicles' positions, velocities, and interactions are still realistic, maintaining the consistency with the driving intentions and the environmental conditions.
At 2.5 seconds: The scenario continues to be realistic, with the vehicles' movements and interactions aligning with the driving intentions and the environmental conditions.
At 3.0 seconds: The scenario remains realistic, with the vehicles' positions, velocities, and interactions staying consistent with the driving intentions and the environmental conditions.

Realism Score for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: 10.0
At 0.5 seconds: 10.0
At 1.0 seconds: 10.0
At 1.5 seconds: 10.0
At 2.0 seconds: 10.0
At 2.5 seconds: 10.0
At 3.0 seconds: 10.0

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario is realistic as the movements, positions, velocities, and interactions of the ego vehicle and NPC align with their driving intentions and the specified environmental conditions. The scenario is consistent and maintains realism throughout the duration.
