model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,

<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>

At 0.5 seconds: Both Ego0 and NPC0 are moving with realistic velocities and positions. The scenario continues to be realistic. Realism Score: 9.0
At 1.0 seconds: The movements of Ego0 and NPC0 continue to be realistic, and the scenario maintains its realism. Realism Score: 9.0
At 1.5 seconds: The movements and positions of Ego0 and NPC0 are consistent with realistic driving behavior, maintaining the scenario's realism. Realism Score: 9.0
At 2.0 seconds: The scenario remains realistic as the vehicles continue to move in a realistic manner. Realism Score: 9.0
At 2.5 seconds: The movements and positions of Ego0 and NPC0 are consistent with realistic driving behavior, maintaining the scenario's realism. Realism Score: 9.0
