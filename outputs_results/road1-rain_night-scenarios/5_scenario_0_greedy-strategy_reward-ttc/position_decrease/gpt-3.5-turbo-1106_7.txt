model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,

Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with Ego0 and NPC0 at rest, which is realistic. The road conditions and weather are also within realistic parameters. Realism Score: 10.0
At 0.5 seconds: Both Ego0 and NPC0 start moving with realistic velocities and accelerations. The behavior of the vehicles is consistent with a rainy night scenario. Realism Score: 9.5
At 1.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move realistically, and their positions and velocities are consistent with the rainy night conditions. Realism Score: 9.5
At 1.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and positions remain realistic, and the simulation continues to reflect the rainy night conditions accurately. Realism Score: 9.5
At 2.0 seconds: The vehicles' behaviors and positions are still within realistic bounds, and the simulation maintains the rainy night setting effectively. Realism Score: 9.5
At 2.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and positions are consistent with the rainy night conditions, and their behaviors remain realistic. Realism Score: 9.5
At 3.0 seconds: The vehicles' behaviors and positions continue to be realistic, and the simulation accurately represents the rainy night scenario. Realism Score: 9.5

Realism Score for each second:
{
"0.0 seconds": 10.0,
"0.5 seconds": 9.5,
