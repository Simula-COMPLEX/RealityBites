You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,

Realism Score for each second:
<realism score for each second>
Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
<evaluation results>
Realistic:
<True or False>
Realistic Probability:
<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with the ego vehicle and NPC0 at rest, which is realistic. The road and weather conditions are also feasible. Realism Score: 9.0
At 0.5 seconds: Both vehicles are moving with believable velocities and accelerations. The behavior is consistent with a rainy day. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move realistically, and their positions and velocities are consistent with the rainy weather conditions. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and positions are still realistic, and the impact of rain on the driving conditions is accurately represented. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.0 seconds: The scenario continues to depict realistic driving behavior and the effects of rain on the road. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and positions remain plausible, and the rainy weather conditions are accurately simulated. Realism Score: 8.5
At 3.0 seconds: The scenario maintains realistic driving dynamics and accurately represents the impact of rain on driving. Realism Score: 8.5

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario is realistic as it accurately represents the driving behavior and the impact of rain on the road. The movements of the vehicles are consistent with the environmental conditions. Realistic: True
