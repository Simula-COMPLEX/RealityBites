model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,

Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with the ego vehicle and NPC at rest, and the weather conditions are specified. The initial positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities of both Ego0 and NPC0 are provided. This setup is realistic and provides a good starting point for the scenario. Realism Score: 9.0
At 0.5 seconds: Both Ego0 and NPC0 start to move with realistic velocities and angular velocities. The positions and rotations are also changing realistically. The scenario continues to be realistic. Realism Score: 9.0
At 1.0 seconds: The movements of Ego0 and NPC0 continue to be realistic, with increasing velocities and angular velocities. The scenario maintains its realism. Realism Score: 9.0
At 1.5 seconds: The movements of both Ego0 and NPC0 remain realistic, with consistent changes in velocities and angular velocities. The scenario is still realistic. Realism Score: 9.0
At 2.0 seconds: The movements of Ego0 and NPC0 continue to be realistic, with further changes in velocities and angular velocities. The scenario remains realistic. Realism Score: 9.0
At 2.5 seconds: The movements of both Ego0 and NPC0 are still realistic, with continued changes in velocities and angular velocities. The scenario maintains its realism. Realism Score: 9.0
At 3.0 seconds: The movements of Ego0 and NPC0 remain realistic, with consistent changes in velocities and angular velocities. The scenario is still realistic. Realism Score: 9.0

Realism Score for each second:
"0.0 seconds": 9.0
"0.5 seconds": 9.0
"1.0 seconds": 9.0
"1.5 seconds": 9.0
"2.0 seconds": 9.0
"2.5 seconds": 9.0
"3.0 seconds": 9.0
