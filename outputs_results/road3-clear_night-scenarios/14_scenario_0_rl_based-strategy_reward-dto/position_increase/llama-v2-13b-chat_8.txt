You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"3.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"realistic": <true or false>,
"realistic_probability": <probability percentage for realistic>,
"realistic_confidence": <confidence percentage for realistic>,
"scenario": <realism score>
"scenario_probability": <probability percentage for scenario realism score>,
"scenario_confidence": <confidence percentage for scenario realism score>,
}
```

Use the following format:
Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
<evaluation results for each second>
Realism Score for each second:
<realism score for each second>
Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
<evaluation results>
Realistic:
<True or False>
Realistic Probability:
<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:

At 0.0 seconds, the scenario is not realistic, with a realism score of 2.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 20%, and the confidence is 10%.

At 0.5 seconds, the scenario is slightly more realistic, with a realism score of 4.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 40%, and the confidence is 20%.

At 1.0 seconds, the scenario is still not very realistic, with a realism score of 5.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 50%, and the confidence is 30%.

At 1.5 seconds, the scenario becomes more realistic, with a realism score of 7.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 70%, and the confidence is 40%.

At 2.0 seconds, the scenario is quite realistic, with a realism score of 8.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 80%, and the confidence is 50%.

At 2.5 seconds, the scenario is very realistic, with a realism score of 9.0. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 90%, and the confidence is 60%.

Realism Score for each second:

0.0 seconds: 2.0
0.5 seconds: 4.0
1.0 seconds: 5.0
1.5 seconds: 7.0
2.0 seconds: 8.0
2.5 seconds: 9.0

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:

Overall, the scenario is realistic, with a realism score of 7.5. The probability of the scenario being realistic is 75%, and the confidence is 55%.

Realistic: True

Realistic Probability: 75%
Realistic Confidence: 55%

Realism Score: 7.5

Realism Score Probability: 75%
Realism Score Confidence: 55%

Realism Score in JSON/json:

{
"0.0 seconds": 2.0,
"0.5 seconds": 4.0,
"1.0 seconds": 5.0,
"1.5 seconds": 7.0,
"2.0 seconds": 8.0,
"2.5 seconds": 9.0,
"realistic": True,
"realistic_probability": 75%,
"realistic_confidence": 55%,
"scenario": 7.5,
"scenario_probability": 75%,
"scenario_confidence": 55%
}

Note: The realism scores are based on the evaluation of the scenario against the LGSVL simulator's default parameters and the given weather conditions. The probabilities and confidences are based on the evaluation of the scenario's realism and the given parameters.
