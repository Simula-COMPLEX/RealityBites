You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,

Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with the ego vehicle and NPC at rest, and the weather conditions are specified. The initial positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities of both Ego0 and NPC0 are provided. The scenario setup seems realistic, as it includes relevant details such as the starting conditions and environmental factors. Realism Score: 9.0
At 0.5 seconds: Both Ego0 and NPC0 start to move, and their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities are updated. The movements and interactions between the ego vehicle and NPC seem plausible, considering the rainy and night conditions. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move, and their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities are further updated. The scenario maintains consistency with the driving intentions and environmental conditions, contributing to its realism. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.5 seconds: The vehicles' movements and interactions are consistent with the driving intentions and environmental conditions, supporting the realism of the scenario. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.0 seconds: The scenario continues to depict realistic movements and interactions between the vehicles, aligning with the specified driving intentions and environmental factors. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.5 seconds: The scenario maintains realistic representations of the vehicles' movements and interactions, considering the specified driving intentions and environmental conditions. Realism Score: 8.5
At 3.0 seconds: The scenario concludes with consistent depictions of the vehicles' movements and interactions, supporting its overall realism. Realism Score: 8.5

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario demonstrates a high level of realism, as it consistently represents the movements and interactions between the ego vehicle and NPC in accordance with the specified driving intentions and environmental conditions. Realistic: True
Realistic Probability: 95%
Realistic Confidence: 90%
