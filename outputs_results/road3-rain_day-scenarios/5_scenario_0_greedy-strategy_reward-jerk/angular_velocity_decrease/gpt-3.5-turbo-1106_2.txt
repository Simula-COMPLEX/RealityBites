You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,

Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with the ego vehicle and NPC at rest, and the weather conditions are specified. The initial positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities of the vehicles are provided. This setup is realistic and provides a good starting point for the scenario. Realism Score: 9.0
At 0.5 seconds: The vehicles start to move, and their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities are updated. The movements and interactions between the ego vehicle and NPC seem plausible, considering the rainy weather conditions. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move, and their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities are further updated. The movements and interactions remain realistic, and the driving intentions of the ego vehicle are consistent with the scenario description. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.5 seconds: The vehicles continue their movements, and the updates to their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities maintain realism. The driving intentions of the ego vehicle to perform a left turn and switch to a straight downhill lane are being executed realistically. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.0 seconds: The vehicles continue to move as per the scenario description, and their interactions and movements are consistent with the rainy weather conditions. The driving intentions of the ego vehicle are being executed realistically. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.5 seconds: The vehicles continue their movements, and the updates to their positions, rotations, velocities, and angular velocities maintain realism. The driving intentions of the ego vehicle to drive without turning are being executed realistically. Realism Score: 8.5
At 3.0 seconds: The scenario concludes with the vehicles maintaining realistic movements and interactions. The driving intentions of the ego vehicle are consistent with the scenario description. Realism Score: 8.5

Realism Score for each second:
{
"0.0 seconds": 9.0,
"0.5 seconds": 8.5,
"1.0 seconds": 8.5,
"1.5 seconds": 8.5,
"2.0 seconds": 8.5,
"2.5 seconds": 8.5,
"3.0 seconds": 8.5

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario maintains a high level of realism throughout, with the movements, interactions, and driving intentions of the vehicles aligning with the specified rainy weather conditions. The scenario is realistic. Realistic: True
Realistic Probability: 95%
Realistic Confidence: 90%
Realism Score: 8.7
Realism Score Probability: 90%
