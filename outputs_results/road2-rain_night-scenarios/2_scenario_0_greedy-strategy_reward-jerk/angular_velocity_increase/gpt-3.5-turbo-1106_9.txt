model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"3.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"realistic": <true or false>,
"realistic_probability": <probability percentage for realistic>,
"realistic_confidence": <confidence percentage for realistic>,
"scenario": <realism score>
"scenario_probability": <probability percentage for scenario realism score>,
"scenario_confidence": <confidence percentage for scenario realism score>,
}
```

Use the following format:
Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
<evaluation results for each second>
Realism Score for each second:
<realism score for each second>
Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
<evaluation results>
Realistic:
<True or False>
Realistic Probability:
<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with Ego0 and NPC0 at rest, which is realistic. The road and weather conditions are not described, so it's difficult to evaluate the full realism. Realism Score: 5.0
At 0.5 seconds: Both Ego0 and NPC0 start to move, and their positions and velocities change realistically. The rain and night weather conditions add realism to the scenario. Realism Score: 8.0
At 1.0 seconds: The movement and behavior of Ego0 and NPC0 continue to be realistic, and the rain and night weather conditions are maintained. Realism Score: 8.5
At 1.5 seconds: The scenario continues to exhibit realistic movement and behavior for both Ego0 and NPC0, and the weather conditions remain consistent. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.0 seconds: Realistic movement and behavior are maintained, and the rain and night weather conditions continue to add to the realism. Realism Score: 8.5
At 2.5 seconds: The scenario still exhibits realistic movement and behavior, and the weather conditions remain consistent. Realism Score: 8.5
At 3.0 seconds: Realistic movement and behavior are maintained, and the rain and night weather conditions continue to add to the realism. Realism Score: 8.5

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario exhibits consistent and realistic movement and behavior for both Ego0 and NPC0, and the rain and night weather conditions add to the realism. However, the lack of description of the road and other environmental factors limits the full evaluation. Realistic: True
Realistic Probability: 85%
Realistic Confidence: 90%
Realism Score: 8.0
Realism Score Probability: 80%
Realism Score Confidence: 85%
