You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"3.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"realistic": <true or false>,
"realistic_probability": <probability percentage for realistic>,
"realistic_confidence": <confidence percentage for realistic>,
"scenario": <realism score>
"scenario_probability": <probability percentage for scenario realism score>,
"scenario_confidence": <confidence percentage for scenario realism score>,
}
```

Use the following format:
Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
<evaluation results for each second>
Realism Score for each second:
<realism score for each second>
Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
<evaluation results>
Realistic:
<True or False>
Realistic Probability:
<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my evaluation of the realism of the scenario:

Evaluation of the Realism for each second:

* At 0.0 seconds, the scenario is unrealistic because the position and velocity of Ego0 are not physically possible. The position of Ego0 is not within the bounds of the road, and the velocity is not consistent with a car traveling on a straight road. Realism score: 1.0.
* At 0.5 seconds, the scenario is slightly more realistic, but still unrealistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are more physically plausible, but the angular velocity is unrealistic. The position of NPC0 is also unrealistic, as it is not within the bounds of the road. Realism score: 3.0.
* At 1.0 seconds, the scenario is still unrealistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are more physically plausible, but the angular velocity is unrealistic. The position of NPC0 is also unrealistic, as it is not within the bounds of the road. Realism score: 4.0.
* At 1.5 seconds, the scenario is slightly more realistic, but still unrealistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are more physically plausible, and the angular velocity is more realistic. However, the position of NPC0 is still unrealistic. Realism score: 5.0.
* At 2.0 seconds, the scenario is more realistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are physically plausible, and the angular velocity is realistic. The position of NPC0 is still unrealistic, but the velocity is more realistic. Realism score: 6.0.
* At 2.5 seconds, the scenario is still realistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are physically plausible, and the angular velocity is realistic. The position of NPC0 is more realistic, but the velocity is slightly unrealistic. Realism score: 7.0.
* At 3.0 seconds, the scenario is still realistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are physically plausible, and the angular velocity is realistic. The position of NPC0 is more realistic, and the velocity is more physically plausible. Realism score: 8.0.

Realism Score for each second:

* At 0.0 seconds: 1.0
* At 0.5 seconds: 3.0
* At 1.0 seconds: 4.0
* At 1.5 seconds: 5.0
* At 2.0 seconds: 6.0
* At 2.5 seconds: 7.0
* At 3.0 seconds: 8.0

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:

Overall, the scenario is unrealistic. The position and velocity of Ego0 are not physically possible, and the position of NPC0 is not within the bounds of the road. However, the scenario becomes more realistic as time progresses, with more physically plausible positions and velocities for both Ego0 and NPC0.

Realistic: False

Realistic Probability: 20%

Realistic Confidence: 30%

Realism Score: 4.5

Realism Score Probability: 40%
