model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,

<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with Ego0 and NPC0 at rest, which is realistic. The realism score is 10.0.
At 0.5 seconds: Ego0 and NPC0 start to move with realistic velocities and positions. The interaction between Ego0 and NPC0 is plausible. The realism score is 9.5.
At 1.0 seconds: The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 continues to be realistic, and their positions and velocities are consistent with a typical driving scenario. The realism score is 9.5.
At 1.5 seconds: The scenario maintains its realism with plausible movements and interactions between Ego0 and NPC0. The realism score is 9.5.
At 2.0 seconds: The movements and interactions remain realistic, with consistent velocities and positions for Ego0 and NPC0. The realism score is 9.5.
At 2.5 seconds: The scenario continues to exhibit realistic movements and interactions, with plausible velocities and positions for Ego0 and NPC0. The realism score is 9.5.
At 3.0 seconds: The scenario maintains its realism with plausible movements and interactions between Ego0 and NPC0. The realism score is 9.5.

Realism Score for each second:
0.0 seconds: 10.0
0.5 seconds: 9.5
