model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106

You know a lot about autonomous driving and some realistic autonomous driving crash datasets.
You are a helpful scenario realism evaluation assistant.
You will evaluate the following autonomous driving scenario, and check whether the scenario is realistic.
You will provide the corresponding realism score. The scale is 1.0-10.0, where 1.0 is unrealistic and 10.0 is realistic.
You will also provide the Probability and Confidence of the outputs as a percentage. Probability refers to the likelihood of your output, while Confidence indicates the certainty in the prediction for your output.
You know the scenario is from the LGSVL simulator.

Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario for each second, and Provide the corresponding realism score.
2 - Evaluate the realism of the scenario according to each second. And Output whether the scenario is realistic, if it is realistic, output True, if not, output False. And Provide the corresponding realism score. And Output the probability and confidence for the realistic result and realism score.
3 - Output the realism scores of each second, and the realistic result and realism score of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format. Here is an example:
```
{
"0.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"0.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"1.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"2.5 seconds": <realism score>,
"3.0 seconds": <realism score>,
"realistic": <true or false>,
"realistic_probability": <probability percentage for realistic>,
"realistic_confidence": <confidence percentage for realistic>,
"scenario": <realism score>
"scenario_probability": <probability percentage for scenario realism score>,
"scenario_confidence": <confidence percentage for scenario realism score>,
}
```

Use the following format:
Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
<evaluation results for each second>
Realism Score for each second:
<realism score for each second>
Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
<evaluation results>
Realistic:
<True or False>
Realistic Probability:
<probability percentage for realistic>
Realistic Confidence:
<confidence percentage for realistic>
Realism Score:
<realism score>
Realism Score Probability:
<probability percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score Confidence:
<confidence percentage for scenario realism score>
Realism Score in JSON/json:
<realism scores of each second, and the realism score and realistic result of the scenario, and the corresponding probability and confidence in a JSON/json format>


Evaluation of the Realism for each second:
At 0.0 seconds: The scenario starts with Ego0 and NPC0 at rest, which is realistic. The road and weather conditions are not specified, so it's difficult to evaluate the complete realism. Realism Score: 5.0
At 0.5 seconds: Ego0 and NPC0 start moving, and their positions and velocities change realistically. The scenario still lacks detailed road and environment information. Realism Score: 6.0
At 1.0 seconds: Ego0 and NPC0 continue to move realistically. The scenario remains lacking in detailed road and environment information. Realism Score: 6.0
At 1.5 seconds: The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 continues to be realistic. However, the lack of detailed road and environment information affects the overall realism. Realism Score: 6.0
At 2.0 seconds: The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 remains realistic, but the scenario still lacks detailed road and environment information. Realism Score: 6.0
At 2.5 seconds: The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 is still realistic, but the scenario's lack of detailed road and environment information persists. Realism Score: 6.0
At 3.0 seconds: The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 continues to be realistic, but the scenario's lack of detailed road and environment information remains. Realism Score: 6.0

Realism Score for each second:
{
"0.0 seconds": 5.0,
"0.5 seconds": 6.0,
"1.0 seconds": 6.0,
"1.5 seconds": 6.0,
"2.0 seconds": 6.0,
"2.5 seconds": 6.0,
"3.0 seconds": 6.0
}

Evaluation of the Realism of the scenario:
The scenario lacks detailed road and environment information, which affects the overall realism. The movement of Ego0 and NPC0 is realistic, but the scenario's lack of environmental details limits the evaluation. Realism Score: 6.0
